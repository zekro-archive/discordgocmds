# Features

- Simply create commands with invoke aliases, permission level, description and help text by creating a class for each command exteding the `Command` abstract class.
- Use whatever you want as Database source to manage permissions and guild prefixes by creating your own database driver extending the `DatabaseInterface` class.
- Permission system using permission levels.
- You can also implement your own permission system into discordjs-cmds2 by using the `PermissionInterface` class.
- Group your commands together
- Automatically created command list and help message
- You can also replace the default help command with your own just by overwriting the `help` invoke.
- Promise-Based safety: Every command will be executed in seperate threads which also will catch all exceptions thrown in the commands code.
- Register your own logger classes based on the `LoggerInterface` if you want to log into a Database or whatever you want to do with it
